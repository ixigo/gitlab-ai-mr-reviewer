## 🤝 Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Help others learn and grow

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- npm or yarn
- Git
- TypeScript knowledge

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ixigo/gitlab-ai-mr-reviewer.git
   cd review-robo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We use **Conventional Commits** for semantic versioning. Every commit MUST follow this format:

### Commit Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- **feat**: New feature (triggers MINOR version bump)
- **fix**: Bug fix (triggers PATCH version bump)
- **docs**: Documentation only
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding tests
- **build**: Build system changes
- **ci**: CI/CD changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes (triggers MAJOR version bump):

```bash
feat!: migrate to TypeScript

BREAKING CHANGE: Source files are now TypeScript instead of JavaScript
```

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
feat(api): add GitLab inline comment support

# Bug fix
fix(parser): resolve markdown parsing issue

# Breaking change
feat!: remove deprecated API endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: Old API endpoints have been removed
```

### Protected Branches

**NEVER commit directly to:**
- `main`
- `master`
- `prod`
- `production`

Always use feature branches:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

## 🔄 Release Process

We use **semantic-release** for automated versioning and changelog generation.

### How It Works

1. **Commits trigger releases** based on conventional commit types:
   - `fix:` → Patch release (0.0.x)
   - `feat:` → Minor release (0.x.0)
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` → Major release (x.0.0)

2. **Automatic actions** on release:
   - Version bump in `package.json`
   - `CHANGELOG.md` generation
   - Git tag creation
   - GitLab release creation

### Branches

- **main/master/prod**: Production releases
- **beta**: Pre-release versions (x.x.x-beta.x)
- **alpha**: Alpha versions (x.x.x-alpha.x)

### Manual Release (Testing)

Test the release process without publishing:
```bash
npm run release:dry
```

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

### Before Creating a PR

1. **Ensure you're on a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```

2. **Update from main**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

3. **Run build and verify**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Stage all changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit with conventional format**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature"
   ```

6. **Push to remote**
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
   ```
